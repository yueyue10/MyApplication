 * We want Dagger.Android to create a Subcomponent which has a parent Component of whichever module ActivityBindingModule is on,

 * nor do you need to tell these subcomponents that AppComponent exists.
 * We are also telling Dagger.Android that this generated SubComponent needs to include the specified modules and be aware of a scope annotation @ActivityScoped
 * When Dagger.Android annotation processor runs it will create 4 subcomponents for us.
